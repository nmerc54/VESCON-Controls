This is the ADC Simulation for VESCON -  a small satellite designed as a part of the Saint Louis University senior capstone. All of the ADC simulation work was completed by Nicholas Mercadante.

Please run "VESCON_controls_main.m" for the controls model. The functions "selectCoilTorque" and "selectThrusterTorque" are the functions that choose which magnetorquer (mag-coils) or thruster combinations should be used to resolve the attitude of the spacecraft.
